  "summary": "All three requirements are implemented. REQ-1: AdminLogin.tsx page created with username/password fields, hardcoded credentials (baslxr/bas12345), error message on failure, and redirect to /admin on success, accessible at /admin-login route. REQ-2: Remember Me checkbox implemented with localStorage persistence for username, password, and the checkbox state itself, with pre-filling on mount and clearing when unchecked. REQ-3: AdminGuard component checks sessionStorage for 'adminSessionActive' and redirects to /admin-login if absent; all admin routes are wrapped under AdminGuard; AdminLayout has a logout button that clears sessionStorage and redirects to /admin-login.",

    {
      "description": "AdminGuard still requires Internet Identity login after passing the admin session check — it shows an Internet Identity login prompt and checks for admin role via userProfile even after the hardcoded-credential session is established.",
      "reason": "The build request states the admin portal login should be separate from Internet Identity and that the Internet Identity integration should not be broken but also not required for admin portal access. However, AdminGuard enforces Internet Identity authentication as a second layer on top of the sessionStorage check, meaning users must also complete Internet Identity login to access admin routes — this was not requested.",
