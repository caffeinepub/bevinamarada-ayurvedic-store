  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 are substantially implemented. REQ-3 is partially implemented — the 'Get Directions' link uses the correct URL, but the iframe embed src uses a generic place-search URL rather than the required new location URL. REQ-1 parallelization via Promise.all is not clearly evidenced in the diff; the skeleton/spinner is added but sequential-to-parallel refactoring is unclear from the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Eliminate unnecessary sequential async operations by parallelizing authentication check, actor initialization, and profile/role fetches using Promise.all where possible.",
      "reason": "The diff shows AdminGuard was updated with a loading skeleton and session check, but there is no evidence of Promise.all or parallelized async operations. The component still appears to use sequential hooks (useInternetIdentity, then useGetCallerUserProfile) without explicit parallelization logic.",
