  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (admin portal routing and guard) and REQ-2 (neon dark theme). However, REQ-1 has a partial mismatch: the spec requires successful login to redirect to /owner-dashboard, but the implementation redirects to /admin/owner-dashboard. REQ-2 is largely satisfied with neon tokens in tailwind.config.js and index.css, but About and Products public pages are not shown in the diff leaving some uncertainty about full coverage.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "After successful login with admin/admin123, user must be redirected to /owner-dashboard. The spec also lists /owner-dashboard as a protected admin route.",
      "reason": "AdminLogin.tsx navigates to '/admin/owner-dashboard' and App.tsx registers the route as '/admin/owner-dashboard', but the spec explicitly requires the post-login redirect target and protected route to be '/owner-dashboard'.",
