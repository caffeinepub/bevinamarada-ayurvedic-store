      "reason": "The diff shows frontend/src/index.css was updated with pharma tokens, but frontend/index.css (root-level) is not listed as a modified file. The build request explicitly names both files.",

      "reason": "The frontend-file-summaries.txt entry for frontend/src/index.css explicitly states it still includes neon theme utilities including neon-text-glow text-shadow, neon-glow box-shadow, bg-grid-neon background pattern, and pulseGlow/animate-pulse-glow keyframe animation.
