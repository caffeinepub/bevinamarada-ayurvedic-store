# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the entire project (frontend and backend) to Version 6, undoing all changes from Versions 7 through 13.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore all frontend files to their Version 6 state
- Restore all backend files to their Version 6 state
- Remove any code, styles, or logic introduced in Versions 7–13 (including z-index/overlay fixes and white background changes)

**User-visible outcome:** The application looks and behaves exactly as it did at Version 6, with no trace of changes from later versions.
