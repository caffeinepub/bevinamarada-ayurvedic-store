The theme must use a near-black background (e.g., #0a0a0a or #0d0d0d), bright neon green accents (e.g., #00ff88 or #39ff14), dark card surfaces, and glowing neon light effects on key interactive elements (buttons, nav links, cards, headings). Update frontend/src/index.css CSS custom properties and frontend/tailwind.config.js color tokens so the neon palette is applied globally. Ensure all pages (Home, Products, About, Contact, AdminLogin, AdminDashboard, OwnerDashboard, StockManagement, SalesPage, etc.) reflect this theme with no remnants of conflicting or default light/blue themes.",
