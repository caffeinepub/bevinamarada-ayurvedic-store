Update frontend/src/index.css CSS custom properties and frontend/tailwind.config.js color tokens so the neon palette is applied globally. Ensure all pages (Home, Products, About, Contact, AdminLogin, AdminDashboard, OwnerDashboard, StockManagement, SalesPage, etc.) reflect this theme with no remnants of conflicting or default light/blue themes.",
